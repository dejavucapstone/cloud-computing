<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

<h1 align="center">Cloud Computing (API RESOURCES)</h1>

This repository contains resources for a Cloud Computing project focused on implementing Node.js with the Express.js framework for backend development 
and mobile app integration.

<h2 align="center">Project Overview</h2>

The aim of this project is to connect mobile apps with a database to enable interaction and perform processes such as CRUD operations. We utilize a microservices architecture for the backend, where the application is built as a collection of independent small services, each with specific responsibilities. All services are connected through a single API Gateway, which serves as the single entry point for requests from the Android application, managing communication and directing requests to the appropriate microservices.

Here's the project scope :

- Creating Database : Created a database with 4 tables (login, user, history, and exercise).
- API development : Utilizing Node.js and Express.js frameworks to develop REST APIs that connect Android applications to databases.
- Microservices Architecture: Implemented a microservices architecture for better scalability and maintainability, with each service handling specific functions.
